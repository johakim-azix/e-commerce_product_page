## My process
For this challenge, i started building the page template (first dom structure and then style) from large to small screens and for each component (header, cart, side navigation, image viewer...).
Once done with the page template, i moved to the javascript. I ended by testing.
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties, Flexbox, animations, transition
- Vanilla js

### What I learned

With my last challenge that you can view here ([the Chat app CSS illustration](https://johakim-azix.github.io/chat-app-illustration/)), i started using animations to improve user experience on my page; so with this challenge i learned a bit more and tried to apply it with moderation.
I improved the way i structure my code both js and css.  

### Continued development

I'll surely keep learning about better structuring my code and project, and some notions i've learned till now.
